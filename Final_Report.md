# Final Report - GSoC 2025: Enhancements to cBioPortal
* **Name: [Rishi Prasad Sulakhe](https://github.com/rishisulakhe)**
* **Project: [Show Variant Allele Frequency in Plots tab and Oncoprint](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/8scNjJhi)**
* **Organization: [cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/cbioportal-for-cancer-genomics)**
* **Mentor: [Onur Sumer](https://github.com/onursumer)**

This summer, I contributed to [cBioportal](https://www.cbioportal.org/) by integrating novel quantitative visualizations for Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) into its core cohort analysis tools. Under the guidance of my mentor [Onur Sumer](https://github.com/onursumer) I focused on bridging a key gap between the qualitative and quantitative analysis of genomic data. I implemented two major features: enabling the Plots Tab to generate box plots of VAF for distributional analysis across clinical groups, and introducing a new VAF heatmap track to the OncoPrint. These enhancements empower researchers to more effectively analyze tumor heterogeneity directly within the [Plots tab](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/plots?id=msk_impact_2017) and [Oncoprint](https://www.cbioportal.org/results/oncoprint?cancer_study_list=msk_impact_2017&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&profileFilter=mutations&case_set_id=msk_impact_2017_cnaseq&gene_list=TP53&geneset_list=%20&tab_index=tab_visualize&Action=Submit), ultimately providing a more comprehensive and intuitive data exploration experience.
